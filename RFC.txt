                            THE CHATOS PROTOCOL


Summary

    ChatOS is a very simple protocol used to transfer messages between users.
    It will be able to connect separately a group of persons in a general chat
    or just between 2 users in a private connection. Each nonterminal packet
    is acknowledged separately.  This document describes the protocol and its
    types of packets.  The document also explains the reasons behind some of
    the design decisions.

Acknowlegements

       The protocol was originally designed by Lo√Øc Jouannisson and Tom Redon.
       It will evolve with the time and the suggestion given by the teaching
       staff.

       The first version as been writen between February and March 2021
